# Get my seal ticket
### Why do you need a seal ticket delivered by vaulth to create your personal seal ?
Vaulth is still on a beta version and we would like to handle first clients as well as possible.</br>
To do that, we decided to create a ticket, that will allow you to create a seal to sign your certificates.

### How can i request a ticket for my account ?
For now, the only way to ask for a ticket is to send us a message on our social network or mail.</br>
On this mail you have to give us your wallet address to allow us to send you a ticket.</br>
Entire vaulth team is on hand to reply to you as soon as possible.

### Where can i send a request ?
You can send a mail at vaulth.contact@gmail.com, request a ticket on our [ticket platform](http://35.180.188.15:8080/) but also contact us via our social media:
