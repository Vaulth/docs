# Vaulth glossary

### Welcome to the Vaulth Glossary a reference hub for unraveling the language of blockchain and art authentication. 
Here, we decode key terms, from certificates to smart contracts, to empower your journey through Vaulth's innovative world. As you explore each definition, you're 
delving into the heart of Vaulth's fusion of ### art and technology. Let this glossary be your guide in unlocking the nuances of our platform, ensuring you navigate 
with clarity and confidence.

## Here's the list of the key terms:

### Vaulth:
Vaulth is an innovative platform at the intersection of art and technology, harnessing the power of blockchain to authenticate and safeguard physical artworks. 
Through dynamic certificates and digital stamps, Vaulth ensures the provenance and authenticity of art while connecting artists, collectors, and enthusiasts in a 
secure and transparent ecosystem. By fusing art with blockchain, Vaulth empowers a new era of trust and creativity in the art world.

### Decentralization:
Decentralization refers to the distribution of control and decision-making across a network of participants, rather than being concentrated in a single authority. In 
decentralized systems, no single entity has complete power, enhancing security and reducing the risk of a single point of failure. This approach promotes 
transparency, autonomy, and resilience within various industries, including finance and technology.

### Web3 Wallet:
A Web3 wallet is a digital tool that enables users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and manage their blockchain assets directly from a web browser. 
Unlike traditional wallets, Web3 wallets are built for blockchain environments and provide secure storage for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital assets. They 
empower users to seamlessly engage with the decentralized ecosystem while maintaining control over their private keys and transactions.

### Token Standards (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721):
Token standards, such as ERC-20 and ERC-721, are protocols that define rules for creating and managing digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 tokens are 
fungible and represent interchangeable assets like cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible and uniquely represent individual items, 
artworks, or collectibles, enabling ownership and provenance tracking.

### Gas:
Gas in blockchain refers to the computational power required to process and execute transactions or smart contracts on the network. It serves as a fee that users pay 
to incentivize miners or validators to include their transactions in the blockchain. The complexity of a transaction or contract determines the amount of gas 
required, making gas a vital factor in ensuring the efficiency and reliability of blockchain operations.

### Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the legitimacy and accuracy of data or identity. In the context of blockchain and technology, authentication ensures the 
validity and integrity of certificates, stamps, and transactions. It establishes trust and safeguards against unauthorized access or tampering, fostering transparency 
and security within digital ecosystems.

### Blockchain:
A blockchain is a decentralized and secure digital ledger that records transactions in a transparent and tamper-resistant manner. It consists of a chain of 
interconnected blocks, each containing a batch of transactions. Through consensus mechanisms and cryptography, blockchain ensures trust, immutability, and 
traceability, revolutionizing industries by eliminating the need for intermediaries and enhancing data integrity.

### Distributed Ledger:
A distributed ledger is a digital record of transactions or data that is replicated across multiple computers or nodes within a network. It differs from a centralized 
ledger as there is no single point of control; instead, copies are held by each participant. This decentralized approach enhances transparency, security, and 
resilience, making distributed ledgers a foundation for blockchain technology and various applications across industries.

### Certificates:
Within the scope of Vaulth, a certificate takes form as a digital representation of an artwork's authenticity and provenance, backed by the ERC-721 token standard. As 
an ERC-721 token, each certificate uniquely identifies a physical artwork, providing an unalterable record of its history on the blockchain. Notably, certificates are 
designed to be living entities, capable of receiving endorsements from stamps, thereby enhancing their credibility and ensuring an indelible, secure, and transparent 
narrative of the artwork's journey.

### NFT (Non-Fungible Token):
A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity for a specific item, artwork, or collectible on a blockchain. 
Unlike fungible assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are distinct and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. NFTs have gained popularity for their ability to verify 
and tokenize unique digital and physical creations, enabling creators to monetize their work and collectors to own exclusive pieces.

### Tokenization:
Tokenization is the process of converting real-world assets, such as artworks or properties, into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent ownership and 
can be traded or transferred in a secure and transparent manner. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, liquidity, and increased accessibility to assets that were 
traditionally less divisible.

### Stamps:
Within the realm of Vaulth, a stamp assumes the form of a digital endorsement, uniquely tied to an individual, institution, or entity within the blockchain ecosystem. 
Notably, Vaulth leverages the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) by utilizing an ENS subdomain of the Vaulth name as a stamp. These stamps serve a pivotal role in affirming 
the authenticity and provenance of certificates linked to physical artworks. By connecting ENS subdomains with endorsements, Vaulth establishes a network of trust, 
enabling users to trace and validate the history and credibility of certificates, fostering transparency and accountability within the artistic community.

### ENS (Ethereum Name Service):
The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized domain name system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It transforms complex Ethereum addresses into human-readable 
names, making interactions with blockchain more user-friendly. ENS enables users to associate Ethereum addresses, including those representing stamps within Vaulth, 
with unique and recognizable domain names, enhancing accessibility and simplifying interactions within the blockchain ecosystem.

### ENS Subdomains:
ENS subdomains are extensions of main ENS domains, allowing users to create customized, human-readable names under their primary domain. Subdomains offer a way to 
associate unique names with specific addresses, contracts, or entities on the Ethereum blockchain. In the context of Vaulth, ENS subdomains serve as digital 
endorsements, uniquely representing stamps and enhancing the authentication and credibility of certificates associated with physical artworks.

### Smart Contracts:
Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain, automatically executing predefined actions when certain conditions are met. These contracts 
eliminate the need for intermediaries by enabling direct, trustless interactions between parties. In Vaulth's context, smart contracts could facilitate automatic 
processes, such as certificate endorsements, enhancing the efficiency and transparency of art authentication.
