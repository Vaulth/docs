# Get my stamp voucher
### Why do you need a stamp voucher delivered by vaulth to create your personal stamp ?
Vaulth is still on a beta version and we would like to handle first clients as well as possible.</br>
To do that, we decided to create a voucher, that will allow you to create a stamp to sign your certificates.

### How can i request a voucher for my account ?
For now, the only way to ask for a voucher is to send us a message on our social network or mail.</br>
On this mail you have to give us your wallet address to allow us to send you the voucher.</br>
Entire vaulth team is on hand to reply to you as soon as possible.

### Where can i send a request ?
