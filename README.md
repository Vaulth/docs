## Genesis
Vaulth is a project started by students developers at EPITECH (Lyon, France) as part of the Epitech Innovative Project.</br>
Our starting point was finding how we can help people with real-life authentication concerns use the security of blockchain technology.</br>
We found out vaulth idea that is a solution which able everyone to create secure digital certificate for differentes type of physical artwork.

## Vision
Vaulth aims to provide tooling for real-world use of blockchain technology to attest the authenticity of physical artwork.</br>
We are effectively digitizing certificates of authenticity and signatures, and providing the necessary tooling for their use cases.</br>
Our goal is to maximize the real-world utility of decentralized certificates.

## Concepts
We built our tech stack on the analogy of certificates and entity seals usually used like proof of authenticity.</br>
An user who want to issue or sign certificates have to mint their personal seal, a representation of a (person, institution, company, etc...) and be use to approve certificates.</br>
A certificate is an NFT extended with signability features that allows the creator to allow other seals to sign their certificate.
