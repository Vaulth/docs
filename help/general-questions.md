# Certificates

A certificate is an NFT extended with signability features that allows the creator to allow other seals to sign their certificate.

Go to the "Create a certificate" page in the "Create" section.

The first step is to add an image of the artwork you want to create the certificate for, the title, the name of the artist, a description, and other fields if you want to. You also have the possibility to create series by adding multiple certificates.

The second step is to choose the stamp you want to use as the creator of this certificate. Click on the stamp that you want, and if you don't have any you can create one on the "Register stamps" page in the "Create" section.

The third step is to mint your certificate. You have to confirm your informations, but be careful: you will not be able to change them after the certificate is minted.
